<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>
Fantasize gives you the opportunity to use data and analytics to assemble the best fantasy football team every week.
</p>
<h3>Application Domain</h3>
<p>
This application will be used by anybody, but we expect most users to be those interested in or playing fantasy football. 
</p>
<h3>Usefulness</h3>
<p>
People strive to put the best fantasy football lineup every week, but often times they fall short. Fantasize will look to give players a better
chance to put the best lineup out beyond what is normally used to make lineup choices for a weekly matchup.
</p>
<h3>Realness</h3>
<p>
The data collected will consist of previous years' statistics for the different players, as well as team defenses. We will look to gain more
data such as what week the game occurred in to further enhance the prediction for our users.
</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<h4>Basic Functions:</h4>
<p>
Insert a new player into the lineup of possible players. Delete players from your team; if you make a transaction or trade, your lineup will change.
Update to add new players (generally newly-drafted players). Searching to find other players that may have a good week based upon our weekly score predictor. 
</p>
<h4>Advanced Functionality:</h4>
<p>
(1) <b> Best Lineup for the Week </b> This function will go beyond the normal task of creating the best lineup given your current players. This function will
look at every player in the NFL and determine who it thinks will score the highest, and will then output a lineup of the top players. </br></br>

(2) <b> Watch Every Game </b> Many people play fantasy football because they love football (makes sense, right?). These people want to watch every single game
they can, but they want a secondary reason to do so: that is where Watch Every Game comes in. It will produce the best lineup possible that includes a player
at every time slot for that week (Thursday, Sunday 1PM, Sunday 4PM, Sunday 8PM, Monday). This gives you the best of both worlds, an excuse to watch every game
and a great fantasy lineup for the week. </br>
